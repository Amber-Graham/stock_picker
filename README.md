# stock_picker
Creating a stock picker with Ruby

<h2>Reflection</h2>
Felt really go about this one from start
to finish! It was very straight forward.

Once I completed the code, I took a 
moment to see if there was any I could
make it look better visually. After some
testing in irb, I realized I had unnecessary 
variables in my code. 

WHOOOPS!

Well, I just realized why it was so easy.
I did not follow the instructions properly.
The only way my stock picker works is if there
is time travel involved. I am going to rework
this now!
